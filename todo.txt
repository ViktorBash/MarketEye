To Do:
-register "marketeye.app" 

-push to production (choose a provider thoughtfully, do I want to learn more, master more, or just do a quick deploy?)

-figure out the scheduling to get new data (should just be a cron job or something, if it is a cron job make sure there is no infinite loop)


Later todo (after already prod):
-Make footer/header icons links
-Make more text/fix awkard emptiness after the "MarketEye makes it easy to see..." text
-add some SVGs that will scale well (similar to spotify) OR, look up a wave tutorial and add a wave
